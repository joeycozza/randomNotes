Painpoints
- npm linking within zion is annoying, webpack watching, latency
- npm linking from cra to zion, same or worse with latency, watching 
- sharing mocks between zion components is not possible right now

Babel w/ Zion Advantages
- theoretically faster cra builds
- follows industry standards
- less customization of CRA webpack.config.js

Zero Transpilation Advantages
- we don't have to worry about getting sourcemaps working right

Ideas
- kLook into at Publish time have multiple outputs. Babel and a src, main and module in package.json
