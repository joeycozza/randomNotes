Hey Webdevs,
  This is a final reminder that we will be deleting the FamilySearchElements github organization soon. All of the
repositories have already been renamed to DEPRECATED_{repoName}. If there is any code in any of the repos that you would like to 
clone or move or save, this is your last chance to do so.

With much love and affection,

The Core Team
