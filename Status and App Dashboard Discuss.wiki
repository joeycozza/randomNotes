build dashboard

= Dashboard Updates =
- remove the 3 component cards on the bottom
- who isn't on the latest zion ui


= Status App =
- Sparkline for each app instead of green and red
- top endpoints of each app
- change the way we pull data out of splunk
- move off of mongo db


= Todo =
- Make list of metrics we wanna see
- decide to what extent do we combine the dashboards
- figure out what kind of backend that we want for the data
- start collecting the data that we want tracked
