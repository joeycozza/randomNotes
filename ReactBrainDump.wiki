= Jeff Meeting React Tasks =
- Deciding to do a clean break for writing react. We are not writing react in the assets/ directory.
  - All written react will be outside of the bifrost app
  - Load react bundle from external dependency

= Some meetings =
- Our Recommendations
  - styleguidist for local dev, demos, documentation, and component catalog
  - Fork CRA and tweak to our needs for now, not creating our own frontier-scripts like paypal-scripts
  - It looks like next.js is probably not a good fit for us right now because of a few caveats like dynamic routing, blocking server side rendering, etc
    - We need to do a quick evaluation of gatsby
    - Continue evaluation of Next.js to more fully understand the potential deal breakers
  - config directory at the root, with ${environment}.cfg
    - and the envvars get built into the built output
  - Styling components with CSS Modules
  - Artificatory/NPM stuff
    - ICS can support artifactory with/for us
      - There are questions that come along with that
  - Monorepo with lerna for shared components 

  - ***Docz for Frontier-Docs (our version of ICS's integration-point)***
    - We need to start documenting our recommendations
  - We need a special slack channel for our Early-Adopters
