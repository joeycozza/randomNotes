Eagle Scout Board of Review:
  It is my privilege to write this letter of recommendation for Zachary Evans, who aspires to attain the rank of Eagle Scout.
I have known Zach for about 3 years, and over the years have seen him exemplify the characteristics of the scout oath and law many times. One example
that sticks out to me is how Zach would help bring his little sister to church while still fulfilling his other church responsibilities. Zach understood
the importance of his committment to God without outside pressure from his parents. Zach is perpetually cheerful and a great friend to those around him.

I absolutely recommend Zach for the Eagle rank award.

Sincerely,
Joseph Cozza
