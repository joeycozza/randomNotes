# Questions/Not sure about
  - Express routing
  - Page titles
  - Page scrolling when routes are loaded
  - Getting info from URL

- Discuss the whens and wheres of an evented architecture
- Pass in a way to do templating to customize list items of a typeahead
  - aka render a component in the dropdown list so they can be customizable

# Linting annoyances
  - once in a while want to disable eslint inline, but prettier moves it off the cur line cause of line length
  - needing &nbsp; (going to try and get us a repodroduction)
  - ++/-- rule needs to be turned off
  - htmlentities must be escaped is an annoying rule
  - Redundant alt attribute ?

# Thoughts
  - Really like how quick and fast you can get your functionality out there. 

- 2 useEffects. 1 to create the map initially, the second one responds to events to move/zoom the map
- Portals to help with react not re-rendering certain pieces of the dom
- Right way of geting access to children element of component as DOM nodes (potentially some funniness with refs)
  - want chilren that are extraneous to the component

- Need a good way of having a button only bound to a single Quote Component, but not another Quote Component
- I wanted my quote component to not have to care about anyone outside of it. Want to expose refresh or other functionality
  - Have a button that calls a function on this component
  - So have a component that manages itself and feel independent

- Once prop drilling gets "painful" then use Context/Providers. But we need a better hueristic than "painful".
  - What are the benefits/gains of using a provider

- Might be useful to do a component review. Coordination of shared components, etc
