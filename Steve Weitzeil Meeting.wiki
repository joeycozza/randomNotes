- Thoughts on the Org
  - I absolutely love the peer-to-peer recognition system
  - The vibe I've gotten is that pushing features is king
    - I've heard others complain about a lack of focus on training and teaching
  - Pretty unimportant, but I'd like some FamilySearch swag. Hat or jacket or something.
    - Talk to Gabe about setting aside some budget
      - RootsTech also has some swag stuff




- Things I've done well
  - Built the component-catalog
  - Made major improvements to frontier-cli tools
    - Auto-updating on dependency updates
  - DTM Phase 2 - Blueprint changes/updates
  - Provided quality support to front-end teams
  - Need 1 more lesson plan for heart specialist
